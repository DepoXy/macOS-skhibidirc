Not your favorite `skhd` config, but a solid No.2
=================================================

## (MOSTLY) DEPRECATED

  This project's bindings have been migrated to a
  [Hammerspoon](https://www.hammerspoon.org/) config:

  https://github.com/DepoXy/macOS-Hammyspoony#ü•Ñ

  - The Hammerspoon config gives us better window and application
    control. E.g., when fronting a Chrome browser window, Hammerspoon
    lets us bring a single window (whether hidden, minimized, or just
    not the front window) to the front without also unhiding or
    fronting other Chrome windows.

    - I originally had such bindings in this project's `skhdrc`, but
      they used a simple AppleScript that would also unhide other
      Chrome windows, which I found annoying. E.g., if I have GVim
      active, I'd prefer that only one Chrome window is fronted,
      rather than multiple windows becoming visible and burying my
      GVim window. (I realize that macOS is application- and not
      window-centric, but I can still pine for Linux- or Windows-
      like behavior.)

  - `skhd`, on the other hand, has its own strengths. E.g., it lets us
    easily change the keybinding action based on the active application,
    or to blocklist certain applications. (Hammerspoon supports this,
    too, but with more lines of Lua than lines of `skhdrc` config.)

    - `skhd` can also hook some bindings that Hammerspoon cannot
      (including, and possibly only including, `<Cmd-Tab>`, or at
      least that's the only binding I know of so far).

  - You might also find the `skhdrc` config more concise than the
    Lua config that Hammerspoon uses.

  - What's left of this project is a simple config loading mechanism
    (see [Private config](#private-config), below).

  Read on for the original project and bindings description.

## DESCRIPTION

  Opinionated [`skhd`](https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd) config,
  but also a few useful AppleScripts.

  - You'll find a number of bindings to front or open specific apps
    by using a global binding.

  - E.g., &lt;`Shift-Ctrl-Cmd-F`&gt; brings Slack to the front,
    or opens it.

    Or try &lt;`Cmd-T`&gt; to open a new browser window.

    And more.

  - This project is not really designed to be used directly,
    except by the author:

    - It's intended instead for other devs to reference, copy, or to fork.

  - Specifically, many of the keybindings are more Linux-y.

    - The author uses
      [Karabiner-Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/)
      and a number of modifications (published as
      [Karabiner-Elephants](https://github.com/DepoXy/Karabiner-Elephants))
      to swap most default `Ctrl-` and `Cmd-` key combos, so that
      their macOS behaves more like Linux Mint MATE (the author's
      other main development environment).

    - In that vein, most `<Ctrl-key>` bindings are mapped to application
      menu items, and most `<Cmd-key>` bindings are free for us to use.

## USAGE

  Make a symlink under `~/.config` to this project's config,
  and it'll be wired (see instructions below).

  You can also edit your own `skhdrc--client` file to add
  your own bindings (or just fork this repo and make it
  your own, or copy-paste what you need for yourself).

  But first, be aware this project uses absolute paths:

  - Because `skhd` runs on its own, it won't have access to your
    local shell environment, and because this project doesn't
    "install" itself anywhere, it just assumes a particular
    path to the AppleScript files:

        ~/.kit/mOS/macOS-skhibidirc/lib

  - Feel free to fork this repo and change the path prefix to match
    your own environment, otherwise you'll want to clone this project
    at the appropriate path:

        mkdir -p ~/.kit/mOS
        cd ~/.kit/mOS
        git clone https://github.com/DepoXy/macOS-skhibidirc.git

  - (FYI, the `~/.kit` directory is a [DepoXy](https://github.com/DepoXy/depoxy)
    convention, which is the primary user of this project.)

  Once cloned, you can wire this app very simply by symlinking
  the config file, [`.config/skhd/skhdrc`](.config/skhd/skhdrc),
  from `~/.config/skhd/skhdrc`:

      mkdir -p ~/.config/skhd
      ln -sn ~/.kit/mOS/macOS-skhibidirc/.config/skhd/skhdrc \
        ~/.config/skhd/skhdrc

## COMMANDS

NOTE: All of these bindings have been ported to the Hammerspoon config.

- These bindings have been moved from the active `skhdrc`
  to an offline config:

  [.config/skhd/skhdrc.OFF](.config/skhd/skhdrc.OFF)

- They're being preserved for reference, so you can compare how
  the same bindings and actions might be implemented in `skhd`
  vs. Hammerspoon.

While this project's active `skhdrc` now defines no bindings,
it still loads the DepoXy and Client configs, should you want
to add your own `skhd` bindings.

### Generic commands

  `<Shift-Ctrl-Cmd-W>`: Hide all windows

### Terminal window foregrounders

  `<Cmd-1>`: Bring to front any window whose title starts with "1. "

  `<Cmd-2>`: Bring to front any window whose title starts with "2. "

  ...

  `<Cmd-9>`: Bring to front any window whose title starts with "9. "

  - The [Homefries](https://github.com/landonb/home-fries) project
    includes a `PS1` setup that numbers new terminal windows when
    they're opened. It works for Alacritty, mate-terminal, and iTerm2
    terminal windows. See:

    https://github.com/landonb/home-fries/blob/release/lib/term/show-command-name-in-window-title.sh

  `<Cmd-M>`: Open a new Alacritty window

  `<Shift-Cmd-M>`: Bring Alacritty to the front

  `<Ctrl-Cmd-M>`: Open a new Terminal.app window

### Browser foregrounders

  `<Cmd-T>`: Open a new Chrome window

  `<Shift-Cmd-T>`: Bring Chrome to the front

  `<Shift-Ctrl-Cmd-A>`: Bring the Email or Calendar browser window to
  the front, or open Gmail

  `<Shift-Ctrl-Cmd-S>`: Bring the Messaging browser window to
  the front, or open Messenger

  `<Cmd-P>`: Bring the [Power Thesaurus](https://www.powerthesaurus.org/)
  browser window to the front, or open it

  `<Shift-Cmd-X>`: Bring the
  [Regex Dictionary by Lou Hevly](https://www.visca.com/regexdict/)
  browser window to the front, or open it

  `<Cmd-R>`: Bring the browser DevTools window to the front

### Application foregrounder-openers

  `<Cmd-F>`: Bring any Finder window to front, or open Finder

  `<Cmd-Grave>`: Bring MacVim to the front

  `<Shift-Ctrl-Cmd-F>`: Bring Slack to the front, or open it

  `<Shift-Ctrl-Cmd-X>`: Bring Spotify to the front, or open it

### Time and date clipboard fillers

  `<Cmd-Minus>`: Put YYYY-MM-DD into clipboard, e.g., "2024-07-08"

  `<Ctrl-Cmd-Semicolon>`: Put dashed date and normal time into clipboard,
  e.g., "2024-07-08 17:14"

  `<Ctrl-Cmd-Apostrophe(Quote)>`: Put dashed date-plus-time into clipboard,
  e.g., "2024-07-08-17-14"

## PRIVATE CONFIG

  The config finishes by loading an optional "private" config
  that you can symlink alongside the main config:

      ln -sn /path/to/my/private/skhdrc \
        ~/.config/skhd/skhdrc--client

## DEPENDENCIES

  - The `<Cmd-1>` through `<Cmd-9>` bindings expect terminal window titles
    to be numbered.

    - See [Homefries](https://github.com/landonb/home-fries) for a
      `PS1` prompt that titles window, specifically:

      https://github.com/landonb/home-fries/blob/release/lib/term/set-shell-prompt-and-window-title.sh
      https://github.com/landonb/home-fries/blob/release/lib/term/show-command-name-in-window-title.sh

  - The Browser foregrounders call `sensible-open` from another project:

    - https://github.com/landonb/sh-sensible-open

    - But you could edit that AppleScript file,
      [lib/raise--chrome--window-or-open.osa](lib/raise--chrome--window-or-open.osa),
      and replace the last command with:

          open location (item 1 of argv)
